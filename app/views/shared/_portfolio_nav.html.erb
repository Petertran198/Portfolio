              <p class="text-muted">Ever since I made a website for a family friend, I knew this was the field for me. I changed from an almost completed business major to web development. Even though I went to school full time, I felt that it was too slow. My hunger to learn more led me to enroll in two coding bootcamp. I was afraid I had too much on my plate, being a full time student and taking on coding bootcamps. It was the hardest thing I ever done, but it was worth it. I ended excelling in both school and the bootcamps. I love this field and can't picture myself doing anything else.  </p>
